# Project Aura

This repository contains the implementation blueprint for Project Aura v2.0. It is a monorepo that organizes the business logic services, AI/ops control plane, platform configurations, and supporting libraries.

## Structure
- **apps/**: Application entry points (API gateway, etc.).
- **services/**: Business microservices (auth, user, payment, notification, analytics).
- **aiops/**: Causal inference engine and remediation agents.
- **platform/**: Kubernetes manifests, observability stack, Kafka topics, security policies.
- **infra/**: Terraform code for infrastructure provisioning.
- **libs/**: Shared telemetry setup and data contracts.

Each service is scaffolded with minimal code to get started. Replace these stubs with real implementations as the system evolves.
